## 💻 About the Project

Front-end technical challenge for the ReciMe selection process. The goal is to develop a main page that showcases trending hamburger recipes, with the ability to filter them by difficulty level—easy, medium, or hard—using the styled-components library for styling.

## 💡 Prerequisites for Running the Project

- The first step is to install [**Git**](https://git-scm.com) on your computer if you haven't done so already.
- The packages we'll be using during the development of this project will be managed by the **Node Package Manager** (NPM), so we'll need to install it. Go to the official [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/) website to install the LTS version. When you install Node.js, **NPM** is also installed on your computer as part of the same package.
- Additionally, it's useful to have a good text editor to work with the code, such as [**VSCode**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or [**Neovim**](https://neovim.io/).
